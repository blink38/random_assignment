# random_assignment
Random assignment is a plugin fom LMS Moodle

Random assignment is an attempt to handle larger classes of students.
For this purpose, we generate a series of html (txt, pdf) files with the
same structure but different numbers. In addition, we generate
corresponding files with hints to solutions for teachers.

Random assignment is a plugin for assignments with following
properties:

- Teacher specifies one or more files for
  assignments and (optionally) solution files with the same names

- Each student gets one of these files randomly 

- In the assignment feedback page, teacher sees the assignment file
  and optionally the solution file as well.
