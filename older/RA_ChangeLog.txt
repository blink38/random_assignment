	* upload.php changes from upload/upload.php copied to
	random/upload.php 

2011-04-20  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 2.0.0

	* final version suitable for production (hopefully)

	* upgrade.php: small improvements. Now each existing random
	assignment in M1.9 is converted into random assignment based on
	upload assignment with default of 3 student files. Before this
	version, number of student files was arbitrary.

	* deleted directory random/db - not needed.

2011-04-14  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 2.0.1.devel

	* upgrade.php should replace mod/assignment/db/upgrade.php. It
	implements full upgrade from 1.9 including file transformation
	from moddata/assignment/random/.

	* Minor output formatting changes

2011-03-26  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 2.0.0.devel

	* New development version for M2.0. Unstable, upgrade from 1.9 is
	not implemented. 

2011-02-26  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* file.php: modified, version 1.46.2.6 2011/02/02. Otherwise,
	the module is not changed.

2009-11-22  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* assignment.class.php: changes due to MDL-20901 (fixed input
	validation)

2009-09-13  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* Minor fixes to avoid notices with php debug = ALL. Thanks to
	Alexandre Belousov.

2009-08-09  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* Added russian translation (ru_utf8). Thanks to Alexandre
	Belousov. 

2009-08-06  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 1.2.5

	* added field that hides description of the assignment until
	available date. Default is not hidden so that there is no change
	in behaviour. If hidden, both assignment description and
	assignment file are invisible until assignment opening
	time. Thanks to Maks Mokriyev for the idea.

2009-06-30  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* English in directoryassignmenthlptext (file
	ran/dom_assignment/random/lang/en_utf8/assignment_random.php)
	cleaned.  Credit goes to Matt Greenwolfe.

2009-05-01  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 1.2.4

	* MDL-16796 was fixed, language files of assignment plugins can
	finally be in their own directories. Until it goes directly to
	core, mod/assignment/lib.php must be patched manually - see the
	tracker. 
	
	* fixed typo in english language
	file ($string['directoryassignmenthlptext'])

	* language files renamed and moved to random/lang directory in
	order to stick to Moodle standards

	* assignment.class.php: changed location of language files that
	conforms with other plugins

	* file.part.php: changes in file.php for MDL-18820

2008-08-14  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 1.2.3

	* assignment.class.php: Copy/paste typo: function assignment_uploadsingle
	should be assignment_random. Seems to be forgotten from 1.1.2

2008-04-09    <fikar@KIRP20>  Version 1.2.2

	* MDL-13792 File uploads created with Japanese file names in
	Japanese Windows and IE cannot be downloaded. Merged from
	uploadsingle.

2008-03-20    <fikar@KIRP20> Version 1.2.1

	* MDL-13899 assignments should be now sending proper submissions
	and grading dates into gradebook. Merged from uploadsingle.

	as 1.1.3

2008-03-04    <fikar@KIRP20>

	* Version 1.1.3

	limit. Merged from Moodle 1.9 uploadsingle.

2008-02-28    <fikar@KIRP20>

	* Version 1.1.2

	* assignment.class.php: Guests should not see assignments - it can
	cause confusion for courses with autologged guests. Some students
	do not observe that thet are not logged in and wrongly assume to
	see their assignment.

	* assignment.class.php: Copy/paste typo: function assignment_uploadsingle
	should be assignment_random.
	
	* assignment.class.php: submissions page now show assignments and
	solutions (it is not necessary to go to individual student to see it).
	
2008-02-20    <fikar@KIRP20>

	* Version 1.1.1
	
	* Bug spotted by Otakar Sprdlik - if teacher marks student before
	student opens it, student will never get a random file.

2008-02-16    <fikar@KIRP20>

	* Version 1.1

	* lang files packaged in _local directories (not messing up with
	standard language files)
